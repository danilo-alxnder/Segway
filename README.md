Welcome to the README of SegwaySystem, a built-in controller model of a pendulum system using bond graph theory

## The Challenge
Designing a controller using 20sim and Matlab capable of accomplish:
1. Model a pendulum's physics.
2. Control the motor's electrical signal based on the model for:  
  ```
  a. Make segway stand still. 
  b. After disturbance ensure segway stand still. 
  c. Drive the segway, turn around and brake.  
  ```

## 
* Following the controllers implemented in this model:  

> Pendulum model               models the physics behing free fall of a pendulum object. 
> Angle PID Controller         controlls the rotation of the wheels of the segway.  
> Velocity Wheel controller    controlls how fast the wheel of the segway can accelerate. 

* Pacman is able to eat Inky, Pinky, Blinky and Clyde through energizers
* After a period of time, ghosts come back to normality
* There is 3 lifes available and fruits are randomly allocated
* Pacman can exist lef/right in the middle borders of the map
